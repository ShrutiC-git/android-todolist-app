# Simple Android Tutorial
This is a step by step tutorial guiding you to build a simple Android app.

## Step 1) Install Android Studio

- identify your platform: `windows/mac/linux`
- follow the steps provided [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html) 

## Step 2) Requirements Understanding
The following points act as a description of the app and as a requirements guide.

Not all points are mandatory.

The developer is free to improvize, improve, add or remove features.

### Task Manager App
Requirements guideline

Build a Task Manager App / ToDo List App.

The app supports multiple task categories such as: 
- work, 
- family, 
- school, 
- spiritual, 
- personal  
- and others.

Each category contains a list of tasks to be done.

Each task can have different properties such as:
- title
- (optional) description
- category
- (optional) deadline

Design and usability suggestions:
- u1) the categories can be selected from menu bar which contain all the categories 
- u2) each category menu item leads to a different screen
- u3) each category screen contains a list with todo-tasks
- u4) each todo-task has a check-box (done)
- u5) when a todo-task is clicked the user is asked to mark it as done
- u6) the main screen contains an image with the user (profile image)
- u7) each screen has a button "add task"
- u8) (optional) done tasks are moved to the bottom of the list
- u9) (optional) sort the tasks by earliest-deadline first
- u10) (optional) each category has an associated color
- u11) (optional) provide the option to add description to a task
- u12) (optional) provide option to change the category of a task

U1 to U12 are user stories.

A **user story** represents a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. 
They typically follow a simple template: As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.

(Optional) More details about user-stories can be read [here](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories).

# Step 3) App Development

Please follow the steps from the wiki.

# Step 4) Evaluation

Each user story values 1 point.

Each user story can gain 0, 0.5 or 1 points.

The app graded with the maximum number of points is considered the winner.
